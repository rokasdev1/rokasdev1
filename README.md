## 🚀 Projects

Here are a few highlights of my work:

### [Project 1: TrackIT](https://www.instagram.com/trackit.kaunas/)
A project which aimed to fix all of Kaunas's bus transportation system in a single app. With bus timesheets, real-time bus tracking with their ,,Žiogas" codes and much more features. This project has won 3 awards in Lithuania. Although the project was not finished, it taught me a lot about Flutter and working in a team as head-developer.

### [Project 2: Notes app](https://github.com/rokasdev1/notes_app)
A smooth notepad app with HIVE & Firebase Firestore integration. Notes are sharable across other users and UI is customizable.
